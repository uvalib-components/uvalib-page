          <p class="bigFirstLetter">The renovation of Alderman marks the third chapter in the University’s history. The first chapter began when the Rotunda, UVA’s first Library, was constructed as the focus of Grounds—a notable departure from the practice of centering universities around religious buildings, which was customary at the time. The second chapter began with the building of Alderman Library, with shelving for a much larger collection of printed information.</p>
          <p>Opened in 1938, Alderman Library became the flagship library of the state’s premier institution. Eighty years ago, it was state of the art, but it was built to serve a much smaller user population, at a time when libraries were used very differently and collections were much smaller. The design has limited flexibility to meet our evolving needs, and apart from the “New Stacks” addition of 1967, no large-scale renovation or re-imagining has been undertaken.</p>
          <p>The renovation of Alderman provides an opportunity for us to bring the Library  up to current standards of safety, accessibility, and service. But more importantly, it is essential to restore Alderman to the position it enjoyed when it opened—a contemporary library with modern amenities suited to the needs of its users.</p>

          <p>As the University of Virginia celebrates its bicentennial, Alderman Library is being renovated and re-imagined. This major capital project marks a new chapter in the history of the University, lays a strong foundation for continued growth and expansion, and creates the hub of the flexible library system that UVA needs as it enters its third century.</p>

          <p>Scholars throughout the University and beyond depend on Alderman Library for access to a wealth of collections, support for scholarship, and services for teaching and learning. Users of the library also come into the building for inperson access to the expertise of librarians, curators, technologists, and other specialized staff. These users have a right to expect a safe environment that meets their academic needs. A major renovation will accomplish that and much more, not only creating an accessible library that is welcoming to all but rebuilding and restoring a building that has become an iconic symbol of the intellectual experience at the University of Virginia.</p>
          <p>In response to a dynamic learning ecosystem, the role of the Library is experiencing a transformation at UVA. The Alderman renovation is a key part of that transformation. Help us cement Alderman’s place as a hub of discovery and learning by making a gift. There are multiple opportunities to make both immediate-use and endowed gifts.</p>
