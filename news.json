Martha was remembered as a leader, friend, and mentor by speakers including\u00a0Provost Tom Katsouleas, Vice Provost Anda Webb, and Library Senior Director of Administration &amp; Planning Donna Tolson.\u00a0The University Library Committee presented Martha with a print of\u00a0one of the Rotunda&#8217;s capitals as a token of their esteem and appreciation, and the Library helped\u00a0transition Martha into\u00a0retirement with gifts to\u00a0cultivate her gardening skills.<\/p>\n<p>Thank you Martha, and enjoy your well-deserved retirement!<\/p>\n<p><em>Scroll through
